# 🖥️ PC Basics — Simple Notes for Beginners

Welcome! This repo is my personal knowledge base about **computers** and how they work.  
I write short, friendly notes for myself and anyone starting out. In case I ever get dementia, I could come back here :) .

> **Goal:** explain the essentials in plain language and easy keywords, while refering to examples like the human body.
