# 🖥️ What is a PC?

A **PC (Personal Computer)** is a general-purpose machine designed for individual use.
It combines **hardware** (the physical parts) and **software** (programs, data, instructions) to perform tasks.
On the other hand, simply a computer can be a machine desgin to accomplish or help accomplish a precise task.

## 🔩 Main Components
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** → the “brain” that executes instructions.  
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** → short-term memory for active tasks.  
- **Storage (HDD/SSD)** → long-term memory for files, apps, and the OS.  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** → handles visuals and parallel tasks.  
- **Motherboard** → the main circuit board that connects everything.  
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)** → provides stable power to all components.  
- **Case & Cooling** → keeps components safe and prevents overheating.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
When you turn on a PC:  
1. The **PSU** delivers power.  
2. The **motherboard & BIOS/UEFI** initialize hardware.  
3. The **CPU** loads the **Operating System** from storage.  
4. The **OS** lets you run software (apps, games, browsers, etc.).

## 🖥️ What PCs Are Used For
- Office tasks (documents, spreadsheets, email)  
- Gaming & entertainment  
- Programming & software development  
- Content creation (video editing, 3D modeling, design)  
- Science, simulations, AI experiments  
- Everyday browsing and communication

## ⚡ Evolution
- **Desktop PCs** → stationary, customizable, great for upgrades and gaming.  
- **Laptops** → portable, all-in-one devices for mobility.  
- **Workstations** → high-performance PCs built for heavy professional workloads (3D, video editing, data science).  
- **Servers** → specialized computers that provide services or data to many users over a network.  
- **Specialized Computers** → smaller or task-focused systems:
  - **Raspberry Pi** → low-cost mini-computer, great for projects, IoT, and learning.  
  - **Arduino (microcontroller)** → not a full PC, but a small board designed to control sensors, motors, and electronics projects.  
  - **Embedded Systems** → computers hidden inside devices (like cars, washing machines, or smart TVs).
