# 🖥️ What is a PC?

A **PC (Personal Computer)** is a general-purpose machine designed for individual use.  
It combines **hardware** (the physical parts) and **software** (programs, data, instructions) to perform tasks.

## 🔩 Main Components
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** → the “brain” that executes instructions.  
- **RAM (Random Access Memory)** → short-term memory for active tasks.  
- **Storage (HDD/SSD)** → long-term memory for files, apps, and the OS.  
- **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** → handles visuals and parallel tasks.  
- **Motherboard** → the main circuit board that connects everything.  
- **PSU (Power Supply Unit)** → provides stable power to all components.  
- **Case & Cooling** → keeps components safe and prevents overheating.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
When you turn on a PC:  
1. The **PSU** delivers power.  
2. The **motherboard & BIOS/UEFI** initialize hardware.  
3. The **CPU** loads the **Operating System** from storage.  
4. The **OS** lets you run software (apps, games, browsers, etc.).
