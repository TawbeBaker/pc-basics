# 💾 Storage: HDD vs SSD

Storage is your computer’s **long-term memory** — it keeps your files, apps, and operating system even when the power is off.  

The two main types you’ll see today are **HDDs** and **SSDs**.

## 🌀 HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
- Mechanical: spinning magnetic disks (platters) + a moving read/write head  
- Slower because it’s physical, not instant  
- Larger capacities for cheaper prices  
- Can be fragile (moving parts don’t like drops)  
- Typical speeds: ~100 MB/s

## ⚡ SSD (Solid State Drive)
- No moving parts, uses flash memory (like a giant USB stick)  
- Much faster, more durable, and silent  
- More expensive per GB compared to HDD  
- Types:
  - **SATA SSD** → older, limited by SATA cable speeds (~500 MB/s)  
  - **NVMe SSD** → plugs into PCIe slots, insanely fast (2000–7000+ MB/s)

## 📊 Practical Use
- OS and apps → SSD (faster boot, snappy programs)  
- Large media collections, backups → HDD (cheap, high capacity)  
- Gamers, creators, and AI enthusiasts → benefit from fast NVMe SSDs

## 📦 Other Storage Devices (just a peek)
- **USB sticks & SD cards** → portable, flash-based  
- **Optical disks (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)** → old-school, mostly for media archives  
- **Floppy disks** → retro tech, now obsolete but iconic  
- **Cloud storage** → technically not inside your PC, but still “storage”

🔎 **Key takeaway:** HDD = cheap, big, but slow. SSD = fast, reliable, but pricier. Most modern PCs use SSDs for speed, sometimes with an HDD for bulk storage.
