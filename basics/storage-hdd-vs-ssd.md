# 💾 Storage: HDD vs SSD

Storage is your computer’s **long-term memory** — it keeps your files, apps, and operating system even when the power is off.  

The two main types you’ll see today are **HDDs** and **SSDs**.

## 🌀 HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
- Mechanical: spinning magnetic disks (platters) + a moving read/write head  
- Slower because it’s physical, not instant  
- Larger capacities for cheaper prices  
- Can be fragile (moving parts don’t like drops)  
- Typical speeds: ~100 MB/s  

---

## ⚡ SSD (Solid State Drive)
- No moving parts, uses flash memory (like a giant USB stick)  
- Much faster, more durable, and silent  
- More expensive per GB compared to HDD  
- Types:
  - **SATA SSD** → older, limited by SATA cable speeds (~500 MB/s)  
  - **NVMe SSD** → plugs into PCIe slots, insanely fast (2000–7000+ MB/s)

## 📊 Practical Use
- OS and apps → SSD (faster boot, snappy programs)  
- Large media collections, backups → HDD (cheap, high capacity)  
- Gamers, creators, and AI enthusiasts → benefit from fast NVMe SSDs

## 📦 Other Storage Devices (just a peek)

Not all storage comes as an HDD or SSD inside your PC. Here are some other common (and not-so-common) types:

- 🔑 **USB Flash Drives (USB sticks)** → small, portable, cheap, and easy for moving files between computers. Usually slower than SSDs, but great for quick transfers.  
- 📸 **SD / microSD Cards** → used in cameras, phones, and handheld devices. Same flash technology as USB sticks, but in a different format.  
- 💿 **Optical Disks (CD, DVD, Blu-ray)** → once standard for movies, music, and software. Limited capacity (700 MB for CDs, 4.7 GB for DVDs, up to 50 GB for Blu-ray). Rare today but still useful for archival.  
- 💾 **Floppy Disks** → retro storage (1.44 MB per disk). Obsolete now, but they were once the default way to save school papers or share files. Fun piece of history!  
- 📂 **External Hard Drives / SSDs** → basically HDDs or SSDs in a portable case with a USB cable. Great for backups or carrying big files.  
- ☁️ **Cloud Storage** → services like Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive. Files are stored on servers across the internet, accessible anywhere but dependent on connection speed and account space.  
- 🎞️/📼 **Tape Drives (archival)** → still used by companies for long-term backups. Huge capacity, very reliable for storage that might sit untouched for years.  

Beyond HDDs and SSDs, storage also comes in portable drives, memory cards, optical disks, and even the cloud. Each type balances **speed, capacity, durability, and portability** differently.

🔎 **Key takeaway:** HDD = cheap, big, but slow. SSD = fast, reliable, but pricier. Most modern PCs use SSDs for speed, sometimes with an HDD for bulk storage.
