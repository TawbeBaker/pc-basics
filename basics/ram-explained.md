# 🧠 RAM Explained

**RAM (Random Access Memory)** is where your computer keeps the data it’s working on *right now*.  
It’s not for long-term storage — it’s for speed.

## ⚡ How RAM Works
- Think of RAM as a **workbench**.  
- The larger the bench, the more projects (apps, browser tabs, files) you can spread out without piling things on top of each other.  
- When the bench is too small, the CPU has to constantly move stuff to slower storage (HDD/SSD), which feels like lag.

## 🕒 Volatile Memory
- RAM is **temporary** → it forgets everything the moment the power is off.  
- That’s why you need storage (HDD/SSD) to save your files permanently.
- RAM is like my short-term memory when I walk into the kitchen…  
I know I came here for something, but the second the “power” (my focus) is gone, the thought (Short term memory) is gone. 😅

## 📊 Key Factors
- **Capacity (GB)** → how many things you can keep active at once.  
- **Speed (MHz/MT/s)** → how quickly data moves between CPU and RAM.  
- **Channels (single/dual/quad)** → wider lanes for more simultaneous data transfer.

## 🧩 Real-World Impact
- Opening 20 browser tabs without slowdown = enough RAM.  
- Video editing and 3D modeling = benefits from more capacity and higher speed.  
- Gaming = smooth performance if the RAM keeps up with CPU and GPU demands.

🔎 **Key takeaway:** RAM is fast, temporary workspace. More and faster RAM means smoother multitasking and less waiting on storage.
