# 🧩 Hardware vs Software

Computers have two main sides: **hardware** and **software**.  
They depend on each other — one cannot work without the other.

## 🔩 Hardware (the physical parts)
Hardware = everything you can **touch** inside or outside the PC.  

Examples:
- CPU (processor) 🧠  
- RAM (memory sticks) 🧠  
- GPU (graphics card) 🎮  
- Storage drives (HDD/SSD) 💾  
- Motherboard 🔌  
- Power Supply ⚡  
- Monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer 🖥️⌨️🖱️  

---

## 💾 Software (the digital instructions)
Software = the **programs and data** that tell the hardware what to do.  

Examples:
- Operating Systems: Windows, Linux, macOS  
- Applications: Microsoft Word, Chrome, Photoshop  
- Games 🎮  
- Drivers (small programs that let hardware work with the OS)  
- Files: text documents, videos, music 🎶

## 🔗 How They Work Together
- Press a key on your **keyboard (hardware)** →  
- Signal goes to the **CPU (hardware)** →  
- **Operating System (software)** interprets it →  
- **App (software)** displays the letter on your **screen (hardware)**.

## 🧠 Analogy
- Hardware = **the body** (muscles, bones, organs)  
- Software = **the mind** (thoughts, instructions)  

The body without a mind can’t act.  
The mind without a body can’t interact with the world.

🔎 **Key takeaway:** Hardware is the physical machine, software is the digital logic. Together, they make a computer useful.
