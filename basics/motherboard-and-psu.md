# 🔌 Motherboard & PSU

Two often overlooked parts of a PC are the **motherboard** and the **power supply unit (PSU)**.  
They don’t directly make your computer “faster,” but without them, nothing else would even work.

## 🖇️ The Motherboard
The **motherboard** is the main circuit board that connects all components.  

- Provides **slots and sockets** → CPU, RAM, GPU, storage  
- Handles **communication** between parts (via chipset and buses)  
- Includes **ports** → USB, audio, networking, sometimes video outputs  
- Stores firmware (BIOS/UEFI) that helps the system start up  

👉 Analogy: The motherboard is like a **city map** with roads and intersections. The CPU, RAM, GPU, and storage are the buildings — but without the map, they can’t connect or communicate.

### 🎨 Integrated Graphics vs Dedicated GPU
- Many CPUs come with **integrated graphics** (built into the CPU itself).  
  - These let you connect your monitor directly to the **motherboard’s video ports**.  
  - Good for light use: browsing, videos, office work.  
- A **dedicated GPU (graphics card)** plugs into the PCIe slot on the motherboard.  
  - Much more powerful — used for gaming, 3D work, AI, simulations.  
  - In this case, the monitor cable should be plugged **into the GPU**, not the motherboard.  

👉 Common mistake: New builders sometimes plug the display cable into the motherboard by accident, which makes the system use integrated graphics instead of the dedicated GPU. That’s why you might see poor performance even with a powerful graphics card.

## ⚡ The Power Supply (PSU)
The **PSU** converts electricity from the wall (AC) into the stable DC power your components need.  

- **Wattage** → total power available (e.g., 650W, 750W)  
- **Efficiency** → rated with “80 Plus” certifications (Bronze, Gold, Platinum…)  
- **Cables** → deliver power to CPU, GPU, drives, and motherboard  
- **Quality matters** → a cheap PSU can damage parts or cause crashes  

👉 Fun note: Enthusiasts often overestimate GPU/CPU power needs, but **the PSU is the unsung hero** that keeps everything running safely.

## 🧩 Why They Matter Together
- A high-end CPU/GPU is useless if the **motherboard** doesn’t support it  
- A powerful build can be unstable if the **PSU** is weak or low quality  
- Balanced systems = reliable systems

🔎 **Key takeaway:**  
The motherboard connects everything, and the PSU keeps it alive.  
The monitor plugs into either the motherboard (for integrated graphics) or the GPU (for dedicated graphics) — knowing the difference avoids a classic PC-building mistake.
